# OpenCVponggame
<h1>Pong game using opencv</h1>
This was the first personal proyect I did in university. Its basically a modified pong game so you could control it using the
computer's camera and some specific color objects. Feel free to use it and make it better. Next improvement could be to modified the code so it could be used in an auditorium full of people, you could give each person a color sign and let each side of the auditorium play against each other.
