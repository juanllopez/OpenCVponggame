# OpenCVponggame
<h1>Pong game using opencv</h1>
This was the first personal proyect I did in university. Its basically a modified pong game modified so you could control it using the
computer's camera and some specific color objects. Feel free to use it and make it better. The first intent was to use it in an auditorium
so the audience in teams divided from the middle could play, each person with a palet with two different colors representing the movemenet. 
But it would have to be modified to count the number of single object color contours, or pixels, are in the image. 
Also special lighting conditions.
